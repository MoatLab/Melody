## Description
Melody is a framework for systematic characterization and analysis of CXL memory performance. 
Melody builds on an extensive evaluation spanning hundered of workloads on different CPU platforms with 4 CXL devices. 
It revealed several interesting insights: 
workload sensitivity to sub-microsecond CXL latencies (140â€“410 ns), 
the first disclosure of CXL tail latencies, CPU tolerance to CXL-induced delays, 
a novel approach [SPA](spa) for pinpointing CXL bottlenecks, 
and CPU prefetcher inefficiencies caused by CXL's high latency.

It contains:
+ [MIO](mio): latency microbenchmark
+ [SPA](spa): Stall-based Performance Analysis
